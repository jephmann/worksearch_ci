WORKsearch (CI) -- README

CodeIgniter 2.1.4 version of WORKsearch.

These notes are subject to change.

=====

December 15, 2013

Today I pushed the CodeIgniter 2.1.4 package to GitHub.

So far, I changed only application/config/database.php before pushing everything
to GitHub.

My intentions with this project are the same as those for the original,
procedural version of WORKsearch, with the exception of self-study regarding the
CodeIgniter MVC pattern for PHP. I had a brief foray with CodeIgniter over a
year ago. Simply, I am renewing my interest here. So far I am encouraged by how
easily things have been going this time around.

For now I intend to use the same MySQL database which is in use at the original,
procedural WORKsearch project. My priority is to continue to work on the
original version before turning to this version.

It may be several days before I start this project in earnest. Even then I might
start with some basic CRUD tests before building any forms and so forth.

So please do not expect much at this project for a while (yet).
